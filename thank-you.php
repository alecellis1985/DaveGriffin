                This site is not part of a government organization. We offer free student loan information sessions that identify federal programs that are available for you. This does not constitute legal or financial advice. If we see an opportunity to help we can prepare and track your federal student loan consolidation documents. You may choose to complete your own consolidation documents based on the federal programs and are not obligated to use a third party resource such as this site. We do not facilitate the negotiation of a debt, the settlement of a debt or the altering of a debt. We are not a lender and do not conduct business in all states.
