                    <hr>
                    <p>With student loan debt spiraling out of control Barack Obama has created legislation that allows millions of regular americans to have their student loans heavily reduced or cancelled completely.</p>

                    <p>The big banks have been trying to keep this under wraps for some time, but as more and more people are getting their loans heavily reduced the word is getting out. Many people are telling their friends about the financial freedom they enjoy after getting their payments slashed by 80% or in some cases having the loans cancelled all together.</p>

                    <p>The program popularly known as Obama Student Loan Forgiveness was written into law as the “William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.”  This program took effect July 1, 2010 after president Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 formerly known as Public Law 111-152.</p>

                    <p>The only problem is that – as with most government legislation – the process is complicated.</p>

                    <p>Few people are able to navigate the law and find the correct paperwork to fill out.  Unless you are a lawyer who has passed the bar exam most people just stop trying.</p>

                    <p>The law itself is 55 pages long and can be found <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ152/pdf/PLAW-111publ152.pdf"> here</a> on the government publishing office website.  As you can see on the government site there are many sections of small font written by lawyers and politicians that are very hard for normal people to understand.</p>

                This site is not part of a government organization. We offer free student loan information sessions that identify federal programs that are available for you. This does not constitute legal or financial advice. If we see an opportunity to help we can prepare and track your federal student loan consolidation documents. You may choose to complete your own consolidation documents based on the federal programs and are not obligated to use a third party resource such as this site. We do not facilitate the negotiation of a debt, the settlement of a debt or the altering of a debt. We are not a lender and do not conduct business in all states.
